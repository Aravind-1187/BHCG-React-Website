			"Mr. Graham had written an essay highlighting the superiority of 'Founder Mode' over 'Manager Mode'. Let us first try to decipher such nebulous terminology.",
			"Founder Mode - this word has become the talk of the town, since its inception in September by Paul Graham, Co-founder, Y-combinator. This term has been mooted about by the sundry pooh-bahs of the entrepreneurial and corporate worlds.",
			"Founder Mode can be interpreted as an unorthodox management style, where the CEO has a more hands-on and domineering approach towards the decision-making and execution of plans. Mr. Graham claims that companies with such flat organizational structures, and where CEOs routinely involve in 'Skip-Level Meetings' show better results. Apple's Co-founder, Steve Jobs, and Airbnb Co-founder Brian Chesky are given as examples of the success of this model.",
			"He also expresses his disdain for text-books like 'Manager Mode' which revolves around the delegation of work in a tall organizational structure, summarized by the hackneyed maxim preached to young founders - 'hire good people and give them room to do their jobs.' He chides organizations for having too many unscrupulous emissaries, echoing the dictum 'too many cooks spoil the broth.' Simply put, he advises CEOs to lead like founders and not managers.",
			"Several start-up moguls including Tobias Lütke, CEO and Co-founder, of Shopify have vociferously supported Mr. Graham's blog. They argue that there are certain things that only founders can do, and managers may find themselves inept.",
			"Dan Rose, who held leadership positions at Amazon and Meta, wrote that Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg “were both micro-managers, deep in the details of the product and business. They never set expectations of autonomy, and they fired anyone who resisted their oversight.” It seems that such 'Founder Mode' idiosyncratic behavior is common amongst successful entrepreneurs.",
			"Founders are the biological parents of the organization and share a personal connection with it. On the contrary, managers have less moral authority to drive change and are considered more disposable. In the end, it is just a job for them. Hence it seems axiomatic to allow the founders-CEOs to be involved in every nitty-gritty of business, as they are the de facto omniscient and omnipotent numero uno of the company.",
			"An example that can be adduced to support 'Founder Mode' is Steve Jobs's intervention in the Macintosh team. His expertise in calligraphy led to the addition of beautiful typography on the computer. This further evolved into the plethora of font options available today, in every computer system. I can list ad nauseam about how the founder's God-like interventions, heroics, and prudence saved their companies from certain doom. Handful founders like Steve Jobs, have had their names permanently etched in the hall of fame and command respect at the highest echelon.",
			"However, there are certain fallacies in the 'Founder Mode'. Not every founder is as ingenious as Steve Jobs or Elon Musk. Not every founder has that temperament or finesse. Not every business may thrive in such conditions. Commensurate to every success story, there are probably thousands of failed enthusiasts.",
			"The best example is that of Rahul Yadav, Founder, and ex-CEO, Housing.com. The prodigal IIT-Bombay dropout had launched Housing.com in 2012, and just two years later, it was valued at over Rs 1,500 Crore. However, the capricious nature of the founder, and his public contretemps with board members and investors, led to his downfall. In hindsight, he may have become the next big thing, if he had the proper guidance. Adam Neuman, co-founder, and ex-CEO, of WeWork, and Elizabeth Holmes, co-founder, and ex-CEO shared a similar fate due to their erratic, eccentric and narcissistic behavior and had to face enormous ignominy.",
			"One can see a direct link between 'Founder Mode' and Franz Kafka's story 'Poseidon'. The story revolves around Poseidon, the God of the sea, and amongst the three most powerful Greek Gods. According to Kafka's chronicle, Poseidon is so caught up with the paperwork vis-a-vis his territory, that he does not even have time to explore his oceans. He could delegate the menial work to his adjutants, but he does not trust them. Instead, he sits at the bottom of the ocean and chooses to do all the grunt work by himself. Hence he is reduced from the papacy to a clerk.",
			"Henrik Torstensson, a venture capitalist, states that some creators aren't great at executing. 'When a startup has reached sufficient scale, a great executing manager likely does better than a bad to medium executing founder,' he concluded. This also resonates with the conventional approach to scaling up businesses. He also cited the example of Satya Nadella- the apotheosis of 'Manager Mode'.",
			"The author has also received major flak online. People have derided him for merely giving 'micromanaging' a more acceptable, sesquipedalian term. Judd Antin, an executive coach, writes in his blog that this new word has been created for founders to expiate their failure to adapt and delegate as their business grows and their penchant for sticking to flawed managerial practices.",
			"It is exhorted by most experts not to look at management in such a bipartisan fashion. While 'Founder mode' brings swiftness and ingenuity, 'Manager mode' promotes stability. Both 'modes' seem to be on par with each other and companies should strive for a via media between them. It's worth noting that in his second stint at Apple, Steve Jobs had Tim Cook by his side, the Google founders were affiliated with Eric Schmidt, and Gwynne Shotwell is associated with Elon's SpaceX. The co-existence of both these modes, in the right amount, is the secret sauce to build and maintain successful organizations."

			"No one on his deathbed ever said 'I wish I had spent more time on my business' - Paul Tsongas, US Politician",
			"The tragic demise of the 26-year-old EY employee has sparked a widespread debate on the toxic work culture foisted by sundry MNCs operating in India.",
			"Anna Sebastian Perayil, a neophyte at Ernst & Young, succumbed to cardiac arrest in July this year. Her parents insinuated that work pressure at EY played a preponderant role in the untimely death of their daughter. They have also lambasted the company for its inhumane work culture and its glorification of overwork.",
			"Aristotle, the acclaimed Greek philosopher, asserted that work is an essential part of one's life and that it is a means to an end. He also believed that leisure is equally important as it gives one time to reflect and explore. In his book 'Nicomachean Ethics,' he states that a person needs to counterpoise work and leisure, to attain 'eudaimonia,' or 'happiness'.",
			"In France, there is a concept of 'Faire le Pont' or 'to bridge.' If there is a holiday on Tuesday or Thursday, the day in between (i.e., Monday or Friday) is considered a paid leave. Hence they are often given 4-day weekends to get away from the hustle and bustle of work life. The average Indian worker clocks 46.7 hours each week, in contrast to Germany's 34.2 hours per week. Most western nations' labor laws emphasize the importance of health, safety, and well-being of workers. Hence products or services crafted by these countries have very high-quality standards and are renowned for their ingenuity and originality.",
			"In contrast, Asian countries like Japan suffer from the problem of being overworked. Karoshi, or 'Overwork death,' is something that the Japanese Government is trying to battle. China too, is infamous for neglecting the abhorrent working conditions of its people. Nonetheless, these countries have achieved astronomical growth in their economies, through the sweat and toil of their inhabitants.",
			"Before 1991, the Indian government focused on constructing a closed socialist economy, where the state controlled most of the heavy, technology-intensive industries. The Government did not care about making profits, and the employees could not be fired for not doing work. These institutions were also bridled by labor unions. This created an army of desultory workers. The growth of the private sector was encumbered by the absurd License Raj. It is evident that since the 1991 Liberalization of India's economy, the work culture has taken a paradigm shift.",
			"The internet revolution has further opened up new industries. The sleeping elephant has woken up from a lull ever since. The free market has led to a rise in competition. To compete in the market, companies have to maximize their efficiency. This means employing a minimal number of employees to complete a task. However, the line between efficiency and exploitation is a tenuous one.",
			"Last year, Narayan Murthy, Co-founder of Infosys, exhorted that the Indian youth should be prepared to work for 70 hours a week, for the welfare of the Indian society. Other nabobs from the tech industry, like Bhavish Aggarwal, CEO & Co-founder of OLA, echoed a similar sentiment. According to the Factories Act 1948, workers should be paid double the regular rate for any work beyond the standard 48 hours per week. The question that inexorably arises is - Are companies ready to compensate their employees for their overtime and extra efforts?",
			"It is also to be noted that India has laws like the Factories Act 1948 and the Shops and Establishments Act to protect workers from exploitation; however, they are regularly flouted by rapacious managers. They are not perturbed by their exploitative tactics, as they see employees as easily replaceable gunk, and often seek to hire candidates who can acquiesce to their impossible deadlines and inhumane work conditions. Therefore, more than 51% of India's workforce logs more than 49 hours weekly.",
			"For improving the lives of employees, strong labor unions can be established, but they have a history of marring companies with inefficiency. However, exponential growth in the economy bolstered by efficient companies is of no use if it takes a toll on the mental health of its people.",
			"Therefore, a healthy Modus Vivendi should be reached between employees and companies. The Government should take measures so that workers can lead a reasonable work-life balance, without reimplementing the draconian statism policies. Schools and colleges' curricula should emphasize important skills like teamwork and how to treat subordinates or superiors. The Indian corporate should jettison its toxic traits to make way for a more humane and conducive work environment, which inevitably increases efficiency."

		"date": "2024-11-06",
		"author": "Atharva Mishra",
		"content": [
			"According to a report titled “India GCC Landscape Report: The 5-Year Journey” by Nasscom-Zinnov in September 2024, 70% of Fortune 500 Companies will proliferate their presence in the Indian Market by 2030. Let us delve further into this matter.",
			"Global Capacity centers or GCC  are offshore units of MNC's (Multinational Corporations) which manage  a wide gamut of processes and tasks under the aegis of its parent company. To understand their evolution, we need to start from the very beginning.",
			"In 1835, Lord Macaulay introduced an education system in India to anglicize Indians to perform menial tasks needed to govern the huge public under the British Raj. The infamous quote by Lord Macaulay aptly summarizes his intentions ”Indian in blood and color but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect”. Thereafter English was heavily promoted in schools, but India lost out on its indigenous culture, linguistic diversity, Gurukuls, etc. ",
			"Fast Forward to the post-independence era, Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) 1974 prevented the development of MNC's in India. According to FERA, all foreign companies had to dilute their shareholdings to 40 percent and needed permission from the RBI to operate in India, if their shareholding was higher. This led to high profile companies like Coca- Cola and IBM to exit the country. In FERA, forex was considered a scarce resource and its purpose was the preservation of this valuable asset.",
			"In 1998, this law was repealed. FERA was replaced by Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) 1999. FEMA focussed on increasing the forex, by promoting foreign trade and payment. Furthermore FEMA also repealed the draconian statist policies which were followed till then. This opened the floodgates for MNCs to invest, expand, and operate in India. Macaulay's education system had already created an army of English speaking zombies, which incidentally , was the need of the hour for these companies. Hence in the early 2000s, Indians were considered a cheaper, English speaking alternative workforce.",
			"In its nascent stages, GCCs was characterized by the establishment of a plethora of call centers and IT centers to delegate menial, repetitive tasks of putative MNC's. But according to Pundits of the business world, the Indian GCC market is currently observing a qualitative and quantitative transformation.",
			"This topic reminds me of John Jeffcoats magnum opus titled  “Outsourced (2006)”. The film revolves around Todd, a Seattle based novelty products salesman. He is informed that his work is being outsourced to a small call center in Gharapuri, and is arm-twisted into training his replacements. Todd, a greenhorn in India, is initially chagrined by the cultural change foisted upon him. He eventually reconciles with the situation at hand and starts loving the country and becomes an invaluable asset to the call center team.",
			"Since then, the Indian GCC Market has matured and grown out of this cliched role. GCCs are no longer limited just to mundane low paying jobs. In fact, the tables have turned. Most of the day zero slots at IITs are reserved for GCCs. GCCs also pay over 20% higher compensation on average, compared to other Tech Services companies. Youngsters are in a constant frenzy to secure a role in the lucrative “FAANG” or  “MBB” or  “Big 4”, which are American based companies. On the other hand, Indian companies like “WITCH” often face the stigma for long working hours and low salary.",
			"While the Covid-19 had a soporific effect on the global market, it bolstered digitalisation. Many industries, like the education sector went completely online during peak covid, and have witnessed an irreversible dependence on online services. Furthermore there has been a great ballyhoo about the emergence of new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and generative AI. This gives rise to a new set of jobs in IT along with the strengthening of ancillary services like prompt engineering and ethical hacking. India produces 1.5 Million engineering graduates yearly, hence the growing tech based industry has a huge talent pool to choose from.",
			"Also, Covid-19 and economic policies to “dampen” its effect has led to cycles of recession and high inflation. This made US Conglomerates analyze their cash flow. Corporations were scrounging for sustainability and profitability in such a volatile period and hence had to restructure their organizational hierarchies.The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimated that nearly 255 million full-time jobs were lost globally in 2020 due to the pandemic. Companies resorted to other measures such as salary cuts and hiring freezes. Such companies have also set up GCCs in India, and generally hire equally talented candidates at the fraction of the salary of their US counterparts, in an effort to tackle the cash crunch.",
			"The 2020-2023 global semiconductor crisis occurred due to a mismatch in the supply and demand curve. The supply of chips was encumbered by USAs trade restrictions on China in 2020. Neon gas and palladium are quintessential in chip production, and their major suppliers, Ukraine and Russia respectively were embroiled in war. In that period a couple of major Japanese based Semiconductor plants caught fire.  To exacerbate the matter, the demand shot up for electronic appliances with stay at home pandemic orders, for which semiconductor chips are essentially a sine qua non. The crisis during COVID 19 further exposed the lacunae in the global chip making  industries. India is expected to take advantage of this vacuum and develop a robust infrastructure for semiconductor industries.",
			"Thereafter, the government launched India Semiconductor Mission in 2021, under the aegis of Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY), to catalyze the Semiconductor Ecosystem in the country. India has also entered into bilateral ties with USA under iCET (initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology) to strengthen the semiconductor manufacturing and supply chain. With projections of market  value surpassing $100 Billion, the semiconductor industry is expected to create between 800 thousand and 1 Million jobs over the next 5-8 years. Semiconductor design GCCs now comprise roughly 4 percent of India's overall GCC landscape, growing at an impressive average rate of 7 per cent annually. As quoted by Shri Narendra Modi, PM of India “when the chips are down, you can bet on India”.",
			"According to the Zinnov-NASSCOM report, more than 74% of the telecom and networking GCCs in India are US-headquartered. In the fourth quarter of 2023, US-headquartered MNCs accounted for about 50% of the new GCCs established in India. This will inexorably lead to a cultural shift towards the west. One can notice in Bengaluru, children are often highly euphoric to celebrate halloween, a largely non religious festival which has been borrowed from contemporary American culture.",
			"On the geopolitical front, overdependence on western conglomerates goes against the conventional Nehruvian Non-Alignment Movement (NAM). It is to be seen how the Government sees to balance this imbalance of global forces? Or will the Indian Government jettison the moral impedance to adopt a more laissez faire approach? Only time will tell.",
			"In conclusion, the evolution of GCCs in India mirrors its economic and technological growth. From their humble beginnings as mere service centers, they have transformed into business units driving ingenious solutions and delivering significant value. The GCCs are here to stay and in the coming years, they are poised to play an even greater role in shaping the country. Sundry factors like the global economic scene with technological advancements puts India in the right place at the right time. India has a real chance to become a global leader in semiconductor and IT, with GCCs playing a preponderant role in achieving the dream of  “The Indian Century”."
